# Digital_Image_Processing
 This repository is dedicated to the tasks and assignments of the Digital Image Processing course I am undertaking this semester. It serves as a comprehensive archive of my work and progress in the field of image analysis and manipulation using MATLAB.
 
 ## Repository Contents
- **Task Solutions**: Detailed MATLAB scripts and functions for various image processing assignments.
- **Project Work**: Comprehensive projects that apply complex image processing techniques.
- **Documentation**: Explanations and discussions of the methodologies employed in each task.

## Learning Objectives
Through this repository, I aim to demonstrate my understanding and application of key digital image processing concepts, including but not limited to:
- Image enhancement and restoration
- Color image processing
- Wavelets and multiresolution processing
- Image compression
- Morphological image processing
- Image segmentation

## Tools Used
- **MATLAB**: The primary tool for implementing image processing algorithms and visualizing the results.
- **Image Processing Toolbox**: An extensive collection of functions within MATLAB designed specifically for image processing tasks.

I hope this repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about digital image processing with MATLAB. Your feedback and contributions to improve the work presented are greatly appreciated.
